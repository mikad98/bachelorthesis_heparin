-- This query defines the cohort used for the ALINE study.

-- Inclusion criteria:
--  adult `physionet-data.mimic_core.patients`
--  In ICU for at least 24 hours
--  First ICU admission
--  mechanical ventilation within the first 12 hours
--  medical or surgical ICU admission

-- Exclusion criteria:
--  **Angus sepsis
--  **On vasopressors (?is this different than on dobutamine)
--  IAC placed before admission
--  CSRU `physionet-data.mimic_core.patients`

-- **These exclusion criteria are applied in the data.sql file.

-- This query also extracts demographics, and necessary preliminary flags needed
-- for data extraction. For example, since all data is extracted before
-- ventilation, we need to extract start times of ventilation


-- This query requires the following tables:
--  ventdurations - extracted by mimic-code/concepts/durations/ventilation-durations.sql

-- get start time of arterial line
-- Definition of arterial line insertion:
--  First measurement of invasive blood pressure
